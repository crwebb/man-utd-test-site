        <h1>Manchester United</h1>
        <h2>A test site to practise images, links, git and more</h2>
        <p>
            This is a test site to <em>revise</em> different html elements and folder structure,
            here we could talk about players, the <strong>stadium</strong>, other information. I could have used
            lorem ipsum but I didn't
        </p>

        <p>
            <h2>Lists of players</h2>
            Here I have listed players <strong>I thought played well</strong>, from best to last and
            an unordered list of players in the past who did <em>not play well.</em>

            <h3>Players who didn't play well</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Di Maria</li>
                <li>Alexis Sanchez</li>
                <li>Schniederlin</li>
                <li>Falcao</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Players I think played best this season (2022)</h3>
